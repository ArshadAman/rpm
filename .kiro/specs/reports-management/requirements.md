# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines the implementation of comprehensive report management functionality for the RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring) system. The goal is to enable healthcare providers to efficiently edit existing vital signs reports and create new reports directly from the patient dashboard interface, enhancing the workflow and data management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare moderator, I want to edit existing patient vital signs reports, so that I can correct any data entry errors or update readings with more accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a moderator views the patient vitals table THEN the system SHALL display a pencil (edit) icon in the top-right corner of the vitals summary section
2. WHEN the moderator clicks the edit icon THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu with all available reports for editing
3. WHEN a specific report is selected from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL open a modal/form with pre-populated vital signs data
4. WHEN the moderator modifies any vital signs values THEN the system SHALL validate the input data for proper format and ranges
5. WHEN the moderator saves the edited report THEN the system SHALL update the database and refresh the vitals table display
6. WHEN there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages without losing user input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare moderator, I want to add new vital signs reports for patients, so that I can manually enter readings that were taken offline or from different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a moderator views the patient vitals table THEN the system SHALL display a plus (add) icon next to the edit icon in the top-right corner
2. WHEN the moderator clicks the add icon THEN the system SHALL open a modal/form with empty fields for all vital signs parameters
3. WHEN the moderator enters vital signs data THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs for proper format, ranges, and required fields
4. WHEN the moderator saves the new report THEN the system SHALL create a new database record and refresh the vitals table display
5. WHEN the form is submitted successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success message and clear the form
6. WHEN the moderator cancels the operation THEN the system SHALL close the modal without saving any data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare moderator, I want the report management interface to be intuitive and responsive, so that I can efficiently manage patient data without workflow interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design that works on desktop and tablet devices
2. WHEN data is being saved THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to provide user feedback
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the vitals table without requiring page reload
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with clear error messaging
5. WHEN the user closes modals THEN the system SHALL properly clean up event listeners and reset form states
