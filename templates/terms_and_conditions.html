        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 23, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Stratton Healthcare / Stratton Health</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) services ("Services"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h3>1. Nature of RPM Services</h3>
        <p>Our RPM service is designed to assist healthcare providers in monitoring certain chronic conditions by collecting health data remotely. The purpose of RPM is to help fine-tune medications and potentially reduce some in-person visits to your healthcare provider over time.</p>
        <p>However, our RPM program is <strong>not an emergency monitoring or diagnostic service</strong>. Readings are reviewed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At most <strong>once per week</strong></li>
            <li>As little as <strong>once per month</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This delay means we do <strong>not provide real-time monitoring or urgent medical evaluation</strong>. Medicare guidelines for RPM is to check the data a minimum of once per month to fulfill their billing criteria.</p>

        <h3>2. Scope of Monitoring</h3>
        <p>The scope of RPM is limited to <strong>one or more chronic conditions</strong> that are predefined and agreed upon by your care provider. This service does <strong>not replace comprehensive care</strong> for all your health concerns. RPM is intended to give you better control over specific health parameters through expert oversight and adjustment from home.</p>
        <p>Our specialties include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hypertension</li>
            <li>Atrial fibrillation</li>
            <li>Atrial flutter</li>
            <li>Supraventricular tachycardia</li>
            <li>Oxygen management in COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) or other chronic lung disorders</li>
            <li>Chronic congestive heart failure management</li>
            <li>Oxygen use in asthma</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Diabetes management is something we specialize in but will not currently offer, and may be added in the future.</p>
        <p>For <strong>atrial and ventricular tachycardia</strong>, COPD, and Congestive Heart Failure, please be advised that these conditions can rapidly decompensate. RPM should <strong>not be relied upon for emergency management</strong> in these cases.</p>
        <p>Your readings will be securely stored in our system, and medications may be adjusted periodically based on those trends.</p>
        <p>We may offer <strong>tiered plans</strong> in the future that allow for closer symptom-based monitoring, which could potentially reduce reliance on acute care. These expanded offerings will depend on available resources and reimbursement capabilities over time.</p>

        <h3>3. Not for Emergency Use</h3>
        <p>Due to the limited monitoring frequency, our RPM services must <strong>not be used as a substitute for emergency or urgent care</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Blood pressure above <strong>190/110</strong></li>
            <li>Oxygen saturation below <strong>88%</strong></li>
            <li>Blood glucose above <strong>400 mg/dL</strong></li>
            <li>Or any symptoms that concern you</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.</strong> Waiting for our RPM review could result in serious harm or delayed care.</p>
